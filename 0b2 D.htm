        Honestly, this part is the hardest. I am a complicated and kind of hard to describe person but I am gonna try my best to do that.
        I am an avid reader, a passionate coder, just fine sportsman and a single teen. I read some thriller-gripping novels, DaVinci Code, Inferno and The Messenger are some of the good apples 
        out there. I started to code at 6 and now know begginer level arduino, intermidiate level python, html, css, JavaScript and advanced scratch.
        I am pretty good at cycling, swimming and at the time of writing I am learning to ski. You can connect with me on social media from the links provided
        in the social section on the homepage. Well thats all about me, I hope you discovered more about my 13 year old adventures through this
        about Ariv website which I took a lot of time to curate and make from scratch. Thanks for visiting, please share ➡️ this website.</p>
